I study the influence of feedbacks related to clouds and aerosols on future climate change projections as part of the [FORCeS project](https://forces-project.eu/). In addition, I have ongoing research projects related to my PhD and postdoc at the University of Exeter. Those include land surface -- atmosphere interactions and how these govern tropical precipitation change, especially over the Amazon basin, Equatorial Africa and the Maritime Continent. Furthermore, I am investigating how the monsoon in South East Asia responds to different land hydrology schemes. 

Most of my research so far has been based on idealised model simulations using the Atmospheric General Circulation Modelling framework [Isca](https://execlim.github.io/IscaWebsite/index.html). More recently, I have started looking into CMIP6 simulations and reanalysis data.
